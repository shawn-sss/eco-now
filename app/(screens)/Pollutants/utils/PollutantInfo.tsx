    o3: "Ozone (O3) at ground level is a harmful air pollutant due to its effects on people and the environment, and is the primary ingredient of urban smog. High concentrations of ozone can cause respiratory problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. O3 forms when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, and industrial sources.",
    pm25: "PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Common origins include combustion processes (like motor vehicles, power generation, residential wood burning), certain industrial processes, and some agricultural practices. They can cause serious health issues like lung irritation, asthma, heart disease, and even lung cancer.",
    pm5: "PM5 particles refer to those with a diameter between 2.5 and 5 micrometers. They are typically produced from crushing or grinding operations and dust stirred up by vehicles on roads. They may not penetrate as deeply into the lungs as PM2.5 particles, but they can still cause significant respiratory problems, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions, older adults, babies, and children.",
    pm10: "PM10 includes particles with diameters that are 10 micrometers and smaller. These particles can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, and long-term exposure can lead to heart and lung diseases. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and mines are typical examples.",
